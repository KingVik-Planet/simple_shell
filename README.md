## General
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Code Style: Betty style. To bechecked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- No Shell memory leaks
- Author Files: AUTHORS file at the root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository. Format: [Docker](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/UL8J3kgl7HBK_Z9iBL3JFg "Docker")
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files end with a new line
- Not More than:  5 functions per file
- All your header files should be include guarded

## Compilation
* Shell will be compiled this way:
~~~~
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
~~~~


## Output Sample:
~~~~
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
/bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
/bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
